Implements the default landing page for Polymer components.

`<core-home-page>` can render an information page for any component.
Polymer components use this component in `index.html` to provide the standard landing page.

`<core-home-page>` is _vulcanized_, which means it contains all it's dependencies baked in.
Therefore, this component is intended to be used only by itself in a page.

This *-dev package contains the raw source and the dependency manifest necessary
to reconstruct `core-home-page\core-home-page.html` via vulcanize.

`<core-home-page>` will set the page title automatically.
